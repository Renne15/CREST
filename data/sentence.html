<p>By the 4-cell stage of C. elegans embryogenesis , a ventral blastomere , called EMS , is already committed to producing pharyngeal and intestinal cell types .</p>
<p>Recessive , maternal-effect mutations in the gene skn-1 prevent EMS from producing both pharyngeal and intestinal cells .</p>
<p>In skn-1 mutant embryos , EMS <font color="blue">instead</font> produces hypodermal cells and body wall muscle cells , much like its sister blastomere .</p>
<p>Genetic analysis suggests that the skn-1 gene product is <font color="blue">also</font> required post-embryonically for development of the intestine .</p>
<p>We have cloned and sequenced the skn-1 gene and describe sequence similarities to the basic regions of bZIP transcription factors .</p>
<p>We propose that the maternally expressed skn-1 gene product acts to specify the fate of the EMS blastomere .</p>
<p>Two types of developmental events can cause an embryonic cell to adopt a fate different from that of its neighbours during a cell division particular contents may be segregated to only one daughter cell <font color="blue">and</font> cells may experience different external cues , commonly in the form of inductive cell interactions .</p>
<p>Work on development in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans suggests that most cell fates are specified without a need for cell interactions .</p>
<p><font color="blue">In</font> particular , the gut cell lineage of C. elegans has been used as a primary example of specification by differential segregation of determinants .</p>
<p>Here I re-examine the role of induction in gut specification by isolating early blastomeres .</p>
<p>In C. elegans , the gut derives from all the progeny of a single blastomere ( E ) of the eight-cell stage .</p>
<p><font color="blue">When</font> a gut precursor cell ( EMS ) is isolated during the first half of the four-cell stage , gut does not differentiate .</p>
<p>Gut differentiation is rescued by recombining EMS with its posterior neighbour ( P2 ) , but not by recombining EMS with one or both of the other two cells of the four-cell stage .</p>
<p>These results demonstrate that P2 induces EMS to form gut in C. elegans .</p>
<p>The gut of C. elegans derives from all the progeny of the E blastomere , a cell of the eight cell stage .</p>
<p>Previous work has shown that gut specification requires an induction during the four cell stage ( Goldstein , B. ( 1992 ) Nature 357 , 255-257 ) .</p>
<p>Blastomere isolation and recombination experiments were done to determine which parts of the embryo can respond to gut induction .</p>
<p>Normally only the posterior side of the EMS blastomere contacts the inducing cell , P2 .</p>
<p><font color="blue">When</font> P2 was <font color="blue">instead</font> placed in a random position on an isolated EMS , gut consistently differentiated from the daughter of EMS contacting P2 , indicating that any side of EMS can respond to gut induction .</p>
<p><font color="blue">Additionally</font> , moving P2 around to the opposite side of EMS in an otherwise intact embryo caused EMSs two daughter cells to switch lineage timings , and gut to differentiate from the descendents of what normally would be the MS blastomere .</p>
